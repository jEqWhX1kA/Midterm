      <h1>The Risks of Cannabis Use</h1>
      <p>
        Excessive or irresponsible cannabis use can lead to health problems such
        as respiratory issues (when smoked), decreased motivation, and impaired
        memory and concentration. Some studies suggest a correlation between
        heavy cannabis use and an increased risk of mental health disorders,
        including anxiety, depression, and in severe cases, psychosis.
        Additionally, cannabis can impair motor skills and reaction times,
        raising concerns about public safety, particularly when driving under
        the influence.

        While cannabis does offer medical benefits, critics argue that its
        recreational use poses risks, including impaired cognitive function,
        dependency, and potential mental health issues. There are also concerns
        about the long-term effects of frequent cannabis use, particularly on
        developing brains in adolescents. Even with medical use, proper dosing
        and medical supervision are critical to avoid negative side effects.

      <h1>The Benefits of Cannabis Use</h1>
      <p>
        Despite these risks, proponents of cannabis argue that, like alcohol, it
        can be used responsibly by adults. When regulated properly, cannabis can
        be consumed safely through non-smoking methods, such as edibles or
        vaporizers, reducing respiratory risks. Education and regulation can
        help minimize public safety concerns, and responsible use can offer a
        balance between benefits and risks.

        Cannabis has proven medical benefits, including pain relief, reduction
        of anxiety, and treatment of chronic conditions such as epilepsy and
        multiple sclerosis. Medical marijuana is increasingly prescribed as an
        alternative to opioids, offering a safer option for pain management
        without the high risk of addiction. Additionally, the legalization of
        cannabis has boosted economies by creating jobs and generating tax
        revenue.
