      <h1>The Risks of Cannabis Use</h1>
      <p>
        Excessive or irresponsible cannabis use can lead to health problems such
        as respiratory issues (when smoked), decreased motivation, and impaired
        memory and concentration. Some studies suggest a correlation between
        heavy cannabis use and an increased risk of mental health disorders,
        including anxiety, depression, and in severe cases, psychosis.
        Additionally, cannabis can impair motor skills and reaction times,
        raising concerns about public safety, particularly when driving under
        the influence.
