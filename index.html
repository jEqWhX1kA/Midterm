      <h1>The Risks of Cannabis Use</h1>
      <p>
        Excessive or irresponsible cannabis use can lead to health problems such
        as respiratory issues (when smoked), decreased motivation, and impaired
        memory and concentration. Some studies suggest a correlation between
        heavy cannabis use and an increased risk of mental health disorders,
        including anxiety, depression, and in severe cases, psychosis.
        Additionally, cannabis can impair motor skills and reaction times,
        raising concerns about public safety, particularly when driving under
        the influence.

      <h1>The Benefits of Cannabis Use</h1>
      <p>
        Despite these risks, proponents of cannabis argue that, like alcohol, it
        can be used responsibly by adults. When regulated properly, cannabis can
        be consumed safely through non-smoking methods, such as edibles or
        vaporizers, reducing respiratory risks. Education and regulation can
        help minimize public safety concerns, and responsible use can offer a
        balance between benefits and risks.
